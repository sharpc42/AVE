The Athena Virtual Environment (AVE) is a wrapper for the Athena++ astrophysical code. It is tailored for undergraduate use especially as well as providing for streamlined use by graduates, post-docs, and professors.

Right now it's tested for MacOS; it'll probably work on Linux but no guarantee yet for Windows. I would recommend manually moving input files to the 'bin' folder in the Athena++ installation for most consistent results instead of letting the AVE do that for you, though it does do a pretty good job of it.
